# DxBot
Simple bot that plays DX-Ball with simple image processing.  <br>
A lot of room for improvements. :)

# Possible Improvements
* When ball goes down mouse goes to calculated x position according to ball's trajectory. It does not account for bounces from sidebars.
* Screenshoting is a very slow process. Any ideas for speeding it up?
